# AmaniCare (Practice Build)

AmaniCare is a privacy-preserving clinical lab anomaly detection system
designed for low-resource healthcare settings.

This repository currently contains a **practice build** used to:
- Validate technical feasibility
- Test model choices
- Prepare for live hackathon development

⚠️ The official hackathon submission will be built from scratch
on a dedicated hackathon branch during the event.

## Core Idea
Detect abnormal lab values (blood chemistry, metabolic panels, infection markers)
and return:
- Anomaly flag
- Risk score
- Possible clinical interpretation
- Verifiable result provenance (IPFS)

## Status
Practice / Pre-hackathon preparation
