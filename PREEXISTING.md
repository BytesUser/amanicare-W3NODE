# Pre-existing Work Disclosure

This repository contains a **practice implementation** created before the W3Node Hackathon
for learning, experimentation, and architecture validation.

- Branch: `practice`
- Purpose: Dry-run of the full system to understand feasibility and flow
- Status: NOT the submission branch

All hackathon submission work will be recreated during the event on a fresh
branch named `hackathon/YYYY-MM-DD`, with live commits during the official
hackathon timeframe.

No pre-existing code from this branch will be directly submitted without
being re-implemented during the hackathon.
