Problem:
Clinics struggle to triage lab results quickly and privately.

Solution:
Amanicare flags abnormal lab results locally.

Demo Flow:
1. Input lab results
2. Model flags anomalies (renal, infection, glycemic, anemia, electrolyte)
3. Explanation shows top contributing values
4. Result pinned to IPFS
